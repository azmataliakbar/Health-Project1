I understand you're dealing with {injury_type} pain/injury. Here's your personalized modification plan:

‚ùå **Exercises to AVOID:**
{chr(10).join(f"‚Ä¢ {exercise}" for exercise in injury_info["avoid"])}

‚úÖ **SAFE Alternatives:**
{chr(10).join(f"‚Ä¢ {exercise}" for exercise in injury_info["alternatives"])}

üí° **Recovery & Management Tips:**
{chr(10).join(f"‚Ä¢ {tip}" for tip in injury_info["tips"])}

üîÑ **Gradual Return Protocol:**
1. **Phase 1**: Pain-free range of motion
2. **Phase 2**: Gentle strengthening exercises  
3. **Phase 3**: Functional movement patterns
4. **Phase 4**: Gradual return to normal activities

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT Safety Guidelines:**
‚Ä¢ Stop immediately if you experience pain
‚Ä¢ Ice for 15-20 minutes after activity
‚Ä¢ Never push through sharp or increasing pain
‚Ä¢ Consider anti-inflammatory foods (berries, leafy greens, fatty fish)

üè• **When to Seek Professional Help:**
‚Ä¢ Pain persists or worsens after 48-72 hours
‚Ä¢ Swelling doesn't reduce with rest and ice
‚Ä¢ You experience numbness or tingling
‚Ä¢ You can't bear weight or use the injured area normally

üìû **Professional Resources:**
‚Ä¢ Physical therapist for rehabilitation exercises
‚Ä¢ Sports medicine doctor for diagnosis
‚Ä¢ Massage therapist for muscle tension relief

Would you like me to create a specific modified workout plan that works around your {injury_type} injury? I can also suggest anti-inflammatory meal options to support your recovery."""

I understand you're dealing with an injury or physical limitation. Your safety and recovery are the absolute top priorities.

üõ°Ô∏è **Universal Safety Guidelines:**
‚Ä¢ **Pain Rule**: Stop any activity that causes pain
‚Ä¢ **Start Low**: Begin with gentle, low-impact exercises
‚Ä¢ **Progress Slowly**: Increase intensity gradually over weeks
‚Ä¢ **Listen to Your Body**: Rest when you need to rest

üèä **Low-Impact Exercise Menu:**

**Cardiovascular Options:**
‚Ä¢ Swimming or water walking (excellent for joint relief)
‚Ä¢ Stationary bike (if lower body allows)
‚Ä¢ Upper body ergometer (if legs are injured)
‚Ä¢ Gentle walking on flat surfaces

**Strength Training Alternatives:**
‚Ä¢ Chair-based resistance exercises
‚Ä¢ Resistance bands (adjustable intensity)
‚Ä¢ Isometric exercises (muscle contraction without movement)
‚Ä¢ Upper body weights (if lower body is injured)

**Flexibility & Recovery:**
‚Ä¢ Gentle stretching (pain-free range only)
‚Ä¢ Deep breathing exercises
‚Ä¢ Progressive muscle relaxation
‚Ä¢ Gentle yoga or tai chi movements

üß† **Mental Health During Recovery:**
‚Ä¢ Set realistic, achievable goals
‚Ä¢ Focus on what you CAN do, not limitations
‚Ä¢ Maintain social connections through adapted activities
‚Ä¢ Consider meditation or mindfulness practices

üçé **Nutrition for Healing:**
‚Ä¢ **Anti-inflammatory foods**: Berries, leafy greens, fatty fish
‚Ä¢ **Protein for repair**: Lean meats, eggs, legumes, dairy
‚Ä¢ **Vitamin C**: Citrus fruits, bell peppers, strawberries
‚Ä¢ **Hydration**: 8+ glasses of water daily

‚è∞ **Recovery Timeline Expectations:**
‚Ä¢ **Acute phase** (0-72 hours): Rest, ice, gentle movement
‚Ä¢ **Subacute phase** (3 days - 6 weeks): Gradual activity increase
‚Ä¢ **Chronic phase** (6+ weeks): Return to normal activities

üè• **Professional Support Team:**
‚Ä¢ **Primary care doctor**: Overall health assessment
‚Ä¢ **Physical therapist**: Rehabilitation exercises
‚Ä¢ **Sports medicine specialist**: Injury-specific treatment
‚Ä¢ **Registered dietitian**: Nutrition for healing

üìä **Tracking Your Progress:**
‚Ä¢ Daily pain levels (1-10 scale)
‚Ä¢ Range of motion improvements
‚Ä¢ Functional milestones (stairs, walking distance)
‚Ä¢ Sleep quality and energy levels

Can you tell me more about your specific injury, pain location, or physical limitation? The more details you provide, the more targeted and helpful my recommendations can be.

Remember: This guidance is educational. Always consult healthcare professionals for proper diagnosis and treatment of injuries."""
